### **Project title:** 
Excursion
### **Description:** 
I am currently learning to use Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages and this simple project helps me practise. 
### **Features:**
The web page I built advertises a mobile app to helps users record and share their experiences, so I used video and landscape imagery to set the scene. Landing page is an important tool in product marketing nowadays, and its goal will be to encourage potential customers to use the product.
### **Technologies:**
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* GitHub
* GitHub Pages
* Command Line
